# Headphones Project

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a responsive web page for headphones. The design has been created in Figma, and this README will guide you through setting up the project and understanding its interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Figma Access**:
   - Create a Figma account if you don't have one.
   - Open the project linked [here](https://www.figma.com/file/your-project-link) and click "Duplicate to your Drafts" to access all design details.

2. **Fonts**:
   - If your computer does not have the required fonts, download and install:
     - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
     - [Spin Cycle OT](#) (insert link if available)

3. **Design Values**:
   - Some values may be in float. Feel free to round them as necessary.

## Interactions

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is **480px** or less.

- **Links**:
  - On hover or active state, links should change to the color `#FF6565`.

- **Buttons**:
  - On hover or active state, buttons should have an opacity of `0.9`.

- **Content Width**:
  - The maximum width of the content should be `1000px` and centered on the page.

## Repository Structure

- **GitHub Repository**: [alx_html_css](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/alx_html_css) (replace with the correct link)
- **Directory**: `headphones`
- **File**: `README.md`

## Development Tips

- Regularly refer back to the Figma file to ensure accuracy in design implementation.
- Test the responsiveness of the website to ensure it behaves correctly at different screen sizes.
